Key Findings (*page number*):

- "social and private returns at all lev- els largely decline by the level of the countryâ€™s per capita income." (1327)
- "The declining pattern of the returns to education is also observed over time (Table 5 and 6) where all social returns have declined between 2-8 percentage points on average in a 15year period. It is of interest, however, that the returns to higher education have increased by about two percentage points during this period, i.e. university graduates were able not only to maintain their position, but also increase their appro- priation of public funds." (1327)
- "Table 7 and Figure 6 confirm that, overall, the returns to female education are higher than those for males." (1327)
- "large variation between the returns to higher education faculties, the lowest social returns being for physics, sciences and agronomy, and the highest private returns for engineering, law and economics." (1327)
