Key Findings (*page number*):

- "Scholarships/stipends clearly emerge as an effective strategy for girls’ education in terms of enrolment and retention, generally at JHS and particularly at SHS level. This strategy promises most impact if targeting methodologies take account of interacting factors which determine educational outcomes (e.g. using wealth and gender as selection criteria), and if conditional criteria (e.g. attendance) are considered. Because of its general focus on SHS, it is cost effective in that the economic returns to girls’ education are greater with additional years of schooling." (43)
- "Peer support and mentoring interventions, including girls’ clubs, are poorly documented but highly prevalent. The evidence that exists shows improved self-confidence as an outcome." (44)
