Key Findings (*page number*):

- "Schultz (2004) has argued that although the assumption that returns on schooling fall as a student extends his or her education into more advanced levels of schooling is common, in Ghana and in many low-income countries, this appears not to be the case." (125)
- "In Ghana, Cộte d’Ivoire, Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria and Burkina Faso, Patrinos et al. (2006) indicated that wage gains associated with each year of higher education are between 10 and 15 percent." (125)
- "the big payoff in wage employment in Ghana is tertiary education" (125)
- "Otoo and Asafu-Adjaye (2011) reported that monthly gross median pay of media workers in Ghana with secondary, diploma, bachelor degree and postgraduate educational attainments were GH¢140, GH¢200, GH¢300 and GH¢350 respectively" (126)
- "results of the probit estimation show that generally, education has a positive effect on the probability of being employed in Ghana" (131)
- "One would expect that the probability of being employed would be much higher than 14.3 percent for individuals with tertiary education comparing with those with no education. However, Ghana’s economy is less modern and the agric sector which employs majority of Ghanaians, 55.8 percent according to Asafu-Adjaye & Otoo (2009), is predominantly traditional and subsistence" (132)
- "The relevance of education to the achievement of the individual’s labour market expectations and socioeconomic development is universally acknowledged. Although evidence around the world on private returns on education vary, generally, returns on higher education are higher in developing countries in comparison with developed countries" (137)
