Concept Note (for Round 1)
===========================
Instructions:

- What is your new venture idea?
We want to understand what will you do, and how specifically
will you do it (details count). If you are solving an existing challenge there is no need to restate the problem.
If you are proposing your own custom challenge, please do explain the problem you are solving and the proven solution you will distribute. Evidence with citations are welcome.
- How will you measure your success, and what milestones do you intend to achieve over time? For instance, how many people will you reach after your pilot, at 6 months, and at 1 year?
- The best ideas maximize impact and minimize costs. What makes your idea cost-effective?
- We believe D-Prize winners can grow to help enormous numbers of people. How do you plan to scale over time?
