Concept Note (for Round 1)
===========================
Instructions:

- What is your new venture idea?
We want to understand what will you do, and how specifically
will you do it (details count). If you are solving an existing challenge there is no need to restate the problem.
If you are proposing your own custom challenge, please do explain the problem you are solving and the proven solution you will distribute. Evidence with citations are welcome.
- How will you measure your success, and what milestones do you intend to achieve over time? For instance, how many people will you reach after your pilot, at 6 months, and at 1 year?
- The best ideas maximize impact and minimize costs. What makes your idea cost-effective?
- We believe D-Prize winners can grow to help enormous numbers of people. How do you plan to scale over time?


### Concept Note

What we need to mention in proposal:

- Sustainability of Program
- Non-Dependence on Donation Inflow
- Scalability


Scholarship programs for students in developing countries exist in great numbers, their only differences lie in their fund-raising strategies, their target 'customer' segment, and how little of a percentage of donations end up in overhead costs. Despite the countless programs, lack of access to education remains an unsolved problem for the great majority of students in developing countries.

What if the solution to significantly increasing access to education does **not** lie in continuously launching more scholarship programs and trying to improve fund-raising strategies, but what if the solution rather lies in ...

Let's move away from developing nations for a minute and let us instead take a look at some countries within the so-called 'developed world'. How is access to education ensured here?

Germany has a student loan system. Even though they are giving away so much, the system itself is still supposed to be profitable^1
